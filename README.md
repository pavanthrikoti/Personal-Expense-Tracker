## Overview

This app allows users to track daily expenses, set budgets, analyze spending patterns, and switch between light/dark themes. It‚Äôs a fully responsive, offline-capable tool, with data stored locally in the browser, making it perfect for personal use. I developed this project to demonstrate my ability to build practical, user-friendly applications with a strong focus on **performance optimization**, **web accessibility**, and **clean, maintainable code**.

## Technologies Used

This project highlights a range of concepts and tools I‚Äôve mastered, with a strong emphasis on modern web development practices:

* **HTML5**: Structured the application with semantic HTML5 tags for improved accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3**: Utilized custom CSS variables for theme management, gradients for visual appeal, media queries for responsive design, and subtle animations for a polished user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implemented the core application logic, efficient event handling, and robust data management.
* **Chart.js**: Integrated for dynamic and responsive pie chart visualizations of spending data, with optimizations for performance.
* **Local Storage API**: Employed for client-side data persistence, securely saving expenses, budget, theme preferences, and currency settings offline.
* **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updated the user interface in real-time based on user interactions and data changes.
* **Event Listeners**: Extensively used to handle various user interactions, including form submissions, button clicks, and dynamic content updates.
* **Responsive Design**: Achieved through a combination of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and well-defined media query breakpoints (768px, 480px).
* **Web Accessibility (A11y)**: Implemented best practices including:
    * Correct usage of ARIA attributes (`role`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-live`) for enhanced screen reader compatibility.
    * Improved color contrast ratios for better readability across themes.
    * Focus management for modals to ensure a logical tab order and prevent focus trapping.
* **Performance Optimization**: Applied techniques like:
    * `defer` attribute for non-critical script loading to improve initial page load speed.
    * Caching computed CSS styles to minimize forced reflows and boost runtime performance.
    * Inline SVG icons to reduce HTTP requests and optimize image delivery.
* **Vercel**: Leveraged for seamless and efficient deployment, demonstrating proficiency in modern CI/CD workflows.

## Project Structure

* **`index.html`**: The main HTML file, providing the overall structure of the application, including navigation, expense forms, summary, analytics, and expense list sections.
* **`styles.css`**: Contains all custom CSS rules, defining theme variables, preloader animations, and comprehensive responsive styling for all components.
* **`script.js`**: Houses the core JavaScript logic, managing expense data, handling user interactions, updating analytics, and controlling UI elements like the theme toggle and custom modals.

## Challenges & Solutions

* **Performance Optimization (TBT, INP, Reflows)**:
    * **Challenge**: Initial Lighthouse audits revealed high Total Blocking Time (TBT) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP) during user interactions, indicating a sluggish UI due to JavaScript execution and forced reflows.
    * **Solution**: Implemented `defer` attribute for script loading, preventing render blocking. Refactored JavaScript to cache computed styles and use `requestAnimationFrame` for DOM updates, significantly reducing layout thrashing and improving responsiveness. Replaced external image assets with inline SVGs to minimize HTTP requests.
* **Web Accessibility (A11y)**:
    * **Challenge**: Identified issues with ARIA attribute usage and insufficient color contrast, impacting usability for assistive technologies and visually impaired users.
    * **Solution**: Enhanced color contrast for key text elements (e.g., `--text-secondary`) across both themes. Implemented comprehensive ARIA roles (`dialog`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`) and focus management for the custom confirmation modal, ensuring it's fully navigable and understandable by screen readers. Added `aria-live="polite"` to dynamic message alerts.
* **Chart Loading**:
    * **Challenge**: Ensuring Chart.js loads efficiently and updates smoothly without impacting performance.
    * **Solution**: Dynamically loaded Chart.js with `defer` and optimized chart re-rendering logic to only update when necessary, using cached theme colors.
* **Theme Consistency**:
    * **Challenge**: Maintaining a consistent and visually appealing design across light and dark modes.
    * **Solution**: Employed CSS variables (`:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`) to define theme-specific colors and properties, allowing for easy and consistent theme switching.
* **Data Persistence**:
    * **Challenge**: Ensuring user data (expenses, budget, preferences) is saved and loaded reliably between sessions.
    * **Solution**: Successfully implemented the Local Storage API for robust offline data persistence.
* **Responsiveness**:
    * **Challenge**: Adapting the layout and functionality seamlessly across a wide range of screen sizes.
    * **Solution**: Designed with a mobile-first approach, extensively utilizing CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries to create a fully responsive and adaptive user interface.

## Future Improvements

* Add export/import functionality for data backup and migration.
* Implement bank sync or API integration for real-time transaction updates (requires backend development).
* Enhance analytics with more detailed reports, trend analysis over longer periods, and predictive insights.
* Add user authentication for multiple profiles and cloud synchronization of data.
* Explore advanced accessibility features for even broader inclusivity.
